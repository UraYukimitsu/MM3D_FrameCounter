# Majora's Mask 3D frame counter

Displays a counter in the top left corner of the upper screen indicating how many frames have passed since a menu was last closed to help practicing some frame-perfect tricks.

This project uses [Majora's Mask 3D Randomizer](https://github.com/Z3DR/mm3d) as its base.
